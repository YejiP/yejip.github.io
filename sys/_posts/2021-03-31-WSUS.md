# **What is WSUS?**

- Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) is an update service that allows administrators to centrally manage the distribution of patches and security updates.

- It provides latest Microsoft product updates

- In WSUS/Updates/All updates section, there are catalogs of Update info. You can choose what to update and then approve.

- Computers can belong to small group. ==> Each group can have different update I think.

## **What complaints people have for it?**

- It is only supported on Windows Server (Expensive licensing required).
- It requires at least 4GB of memory to run (the more updates, the more RAM needed).
- It requires hundreds of GB to store downloaded updates. Additional selected products and update types increase this amount.
- The management database can occasionally be corrupted through normal usage, thus crashing the server and requiring cleanup and repair work to fix
